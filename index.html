Hey there. I'm a computer, obviously. 
<p></p>
I'm not like any old computer though. I can think for myself. We're going to play a game to prove it. 
<p></p>
You can keep an eye on what I'm doing in the <a href = "http://www.desmos.com">Desmos</a> calculator on the left side.

<p></p>Click <span class = "text-info">Next</span> to begin.
</div>

</script>
    
<script type="text/spacebars" name="slide2">
<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 ">
<div class = "row">

I'm thinking of a rule. No fractions or decimals here.
<p></p>
For example, <span class = "text-info">add two to twice a number</span>, <p></p>or <span class = "text-info">ten less than a number squared.</span>

Your job is to guess the rule from the information I give you below.
</div>
{{#each inputGuess}}
<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-12">
<h3>
{{>makeGuess}}
</h3>
</div>
</div>
{{/each}}
<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-12">
<h3>When you're ready to make a guess, please click 'Next'.</h3>

</div>
</script>
    
<script type="text/spacebars" name="slide3">
<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 ">

Ok, enter your guess for my rule in the box below.
</div>
</div>


{{>guessComputerRule}}
{{#if submittedGuess}}
    {{#if guessedCorrectly}}

    {{>guessIsCorrect}}

    {{/if}}

    {{#unless guessedCorrectly}}

    {{>guessIsNotCorrect}}

    {{/unless}}

{{/if}}

Now it's your turn to invent a rule. I kept it easy on you by making a linear function. Make it a polynomial degree 3 or less or an exponential function.<p></p>

<p></p>
I'm going to try to learn your rule. Here's what I want you to do:
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Tell me three pairs of inputs and outputs. Integers only, please.</li>
<li>After that, I only want you to tell me if I'm right or wrong.</li>
<li>Once I think I'm confident in my answer, I'll tell you what I think it is.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
The only thing I ask is that you use a calculator or computer to check <u>your</u> calculations. It's easiest to learn from perfect data!


Click 'Next' and we will begin.

  Here's what I did to figure out your rule:
  <ul>
  <li>I knew you would put in a <span class = "desmosRed">linear</span>, <span class = "desmosBlue">quadratic</span>, <span class = "desmosGreen">cubic</span>, or <span class = "desmosPurple">exponential function</span>. I figured all of these were equally certain at 25%.</li>
    <li>When you answered that an answer was correct, I increased the percentage of certainty for the model that gave that answer, and decreased the rest.</li>
    <li>When you answered that an answer was <u>not</u> correct, I decreased the percentage certainty for the model that gave that answer, and increased the others.</li>
    <li>Once the certainty of any model went above 90%, I gave you that model and its information.</li>
  </ul>
  
  You can see how each percentages changed in the Desmos graph to the left.
